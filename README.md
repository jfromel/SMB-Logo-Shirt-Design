# SMB-Logo-Shirt-Design
Calling all designers who are staring at their printer thinking about how they can do a 10 stack 3dVerk. Please help design our Logo and Swag. Seattle Mask Brigade logo and swag design to raise awareness and thank our health care workers in the fight against Covid-19. People who want to show their support can purchase a T-shirt/cap or other swag. All profits from the sale of swag will go directly to cover the expenses of Seattle Mask Brigade. 

This project should not be a contest and rather a collaborative effort. This is open source and collaborative, remixes are allowed and encouraged. So please post your ideas, pics and files. I want to get this done as quickly as possible with consensus of the group. Once the design is finalized it will only take a few minutes to make the swag available for purchase using an on demand print service. 

Ideas so far are:
1. Marathon style shirt with sponsors logos on it like Fremont Laser and others.
2. Concert tour style with the back of the shirt listing the dates/PPE qty/ and location just like all the stops on a tour are listed. 
3. Logo idea SMB that looks like a mask, the S and B are the wings and the "M" is the Mask part. 
4. No C-19, like a no parking sign but with "C19" instead of "P"
5. Incorporate the designs we are making like the 3dVerk or show props to local 3dPrintingNerd with his Manta Shield.
